This is the Student Robotics rotating scorebaord for the competition day.
It shows:
 * Scehdule
 * Socres
 * Upcoming matches

It interacts with the same database that the competition radio scripts do in
order to present the latest data at all times.

It is a PHP and Mochikit web application.

You should create a file called pass.php in the info folder with the database
information in. It should use this template:

<?php
$mysql_details = array('host' => 'db-host',
		       'user' => 'db-user',
		   'password' => 'db-password' );
?>
